Hello.

My name is Eran Zimbler, and I like to think of myself as a software engineer.

I currently work at [Rumble News](http://rumble.me) as DevOps Lead. Before Rumble I worked at [AVG Technologies Israel](https://avg.com) (previously AVG Mobile) and at [Check Point Software Technologiess](https://checkpoint.com).

When not working, I read about technology and programming, Try to work on personal projects, catch a show or two with my wife, meet with friends, and the most important thing in the last few months spend some time with my kid. 

Well maybe those are lots of hobbies.

On a side note while I do ride roller skates it is not a hobby, this is a way to move around in a relaxing way.
