Recently I got the amazing chance to give an [ignite talk](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-telaviv/program/ignite_eran_zimbler.html) at [DevOps Days TLV 2015](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-telaviv).

And Today they published the videos.

I recommend also Corey Quinn ignite talk, it is amazingly funny. [DevOps Coping Strategy #1 - Corey Quinn](https://youtu.be/sZy-BAzUO4g)
