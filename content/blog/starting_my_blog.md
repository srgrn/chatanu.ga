Well here goes another blog experiment.

this time it is a static blog, created using [hugo](gohugo.io) based on tricks learned from [npf.io](https://github.com/natefinch/npf).

Like each of the previous experiments instead of creating content I mess around with the technology.
So here is the first post on how this blog got created including some tips for free blog generation.
## Steps:
1. [get a new domain name.](#getdomain)
1. find a new way to create a website - choose static site creation.
1. find a place to host static files.
1. start messing around with the engine of choice.
1. create a github repo for the source of the blog.
1. (optional) automatic build and deployment based on the selected tools and host.

### <a name="getdomain"></a>1. Get a new domain name.

There are many ways to get a new domain name, the easiest one is to pay. 

I have several unused domains laying around but since a new one was needed.

A quick search found Dot.tk which gives away .TK domains, and from there [Freenom](http://www.freenom.com/) that offer .GA domains for free.

After a quick registration the domain chatanu.ga was registered (missplled chattanoo.ga which is proably still available) and after a couple of minutes I it with [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for DNS and since it gives caching for simple sites for free.
