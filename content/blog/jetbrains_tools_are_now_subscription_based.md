Two days ago jetbrains has released the [Jetbrains toolbox](http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2015/09/03/introducing-jetbrains-toolbox/).

This is an a very good offer, while it is not the same as buying a license forever (like for example sublime text) it does allow you getting all jetbrains tools for a year for a very good price. I suggest you'll have a look if you are a jetbrains tool user.

Also for students they seem to have a free educational license to the toolbox which includes resharper and all their IDE's.
