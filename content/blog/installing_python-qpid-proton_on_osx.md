For Azure event hubs you can use AMQP 1.0 protocol, and the recommended way is [Apache Qpid-proton](https://qpid.apache.org/proton/) and for python it has a module python-qpid-proton.

This is how I got it working.

When running pip install on my mac laptop I got the following error:

which was annoying as I did install openssl through brew with  ```brew install openssl```.

The solution was much simpler than expected. Proably almost anyone already know it. adding openssl to the include path.

So the command was changed to:
```
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"; pip install python-qpid-proton
```

Which added openssl allowing me to install proton.

And another related thought:

For the examples to work I have do have the config file from the examples folder of proton and export the path for the config with ```export PN_SASL_CONFIG_PATH=<config_folder>```
