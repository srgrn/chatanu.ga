How to begin a post that should have been written a month ago?

Last month I left my position at Rumble News and moved on to start in a small startup called (Cloud of Things)[http://cloudofthings.com]. This was a very hard decision which at the moment seems to be correct.

I got a new job description and new responsiblites, which are new to me since this is a much smaller startup, and everything is a bit different.

I hope to continue blogging andnot forget it again.


So here to a new beginnings.
