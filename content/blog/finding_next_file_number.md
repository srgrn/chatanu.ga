Yesterday I encountered a tiny problem. 
When creating a file using the ```hugo new``` command it doesn't create the file if it already exists.

This is not really a problem of the code, as you are not supposed to have multiple posts with the same file name, but since I created a plugin that runs the command for me it was required.

This simple problem became annoyingly complicated. The first step was stackoverflow.com, but the solutions there were not exactly what I wanted, eventually after half a day of pondering, I went back to my Perl roots and used a regex, creating the following solution.

{{< highlight python >}}
        index = 1
        import re
        while os.path.exists(os.path.join(dirpath, name)):
            exp = r'_\d*.md$'
            if index == 1:
                exp = r'.md$'
            name = re.sub(exp, '_' + str(index) + '.md', name)
            index += 1
{{< /highlight >}}

This is working only on .md files but it works fine. it can be easily changed to extract the ext part using os.path.splitext method.
