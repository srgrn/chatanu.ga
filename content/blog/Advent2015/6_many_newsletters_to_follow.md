Newsletters were an old concept that went through a revival in the last couple of years.
There are so many newspapers that it is hard to follow and to choose.

A good newsletter is basically allowing you to say "I want someone else to curate content for me.". 
There are so many things happening daily that it became impossible to follow all sources on your own. 

During the years I subscribed to more and more newsletters that now sometimes I get a backlog of newsletters to read. Below is a short list of good newsletters that others might find interesting.
<!--more-->

 - [Cooper Press](https://cooperpress.com/): They started from a ruby newsletter if I'm not mistaken and today have many other programming and software related newsletters.
 I am subscribed to: [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/), [Golang Weekly](http://golangweekly.com/) and [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) and I used to be subscribed to a few others before it got too much.
 - [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/): Curated by Oren Ellenbogen a software lead veteran. Usually contains at least one thought provoking article about leadership in technology. 
 - [Hacker newsletter](http://www.hackernewsletter.com/): Becouse actually reading hacker news is a work by itself.
 - [Python weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/): For all my python news.
 - [DevOps weekly](http://www.devopsweekly.com/): For devops news usually contains atleast one link to articles from conferences. Atleast one link to a new tool each week.
 - [Hiten Shah Weekly Newsletter](http://hiten.com/): Hiten Shah is the founder of [KISSmetrics](https://kissmetrics.com/) and [Crazy Egg](http://www.crazyegg.com/) Both are successful Saas companies. In the newsletter there is a collection of Saas and marketing links including recently a link to his own podcast.
 - [Medium Weekly digest](https://medium.com/): While this is not a newsletter it is just the automatic come to medium email based on your past reading and favorites authors. They do tend to hit with interesting stories in most mails.
 - [Code Project Daily News](http://www.codeproject.com/): Usually 8 links a day. This allows to easily stay up-to-date on technology news without actually following everything.


Well there are others that I used in the past but those are the current newsletters I subscribed to. You might be too.
