There are many ways to teach kids to program these days.
Some of them are actually teaching programming other hide it as a game.
<!--more-->

So lets start with the big ones:

 * [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - invented by MIT this is a tool and a language that allows kids to create games and other kinds of simple programs using graphical coding. 
 It is fun and has been translated into many lanugages including [hebrew](http://www.scratch.org.il/). 
 I have tried it myself in the past and it is nice, but hard to master or so it seemed to me.

 * [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com) - This has evolved since last time I played it and now teaches python as well as JS. It is a cute RPG that will not really be understood by younger kids but still fun.

 * [Cargo Bot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cargo-bot/id519690804?mt=8) - While technically it doesn't actually teach programming it does teach all the principals and is really fun game.
 
 * [Hour of Code - Star Wars](https://code.org/starwars) and [Hour of Code - Frozen](https://studio.code.org/s/frozen/) - This is a very simple game based on [Blokly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) which is an open source library for building visual code editors. Both are simple games, but with nice visuals and a story.

 There are so many other ways that I hadn't had the chance to try: Kodable (another game), Lego Mindstorms (will buy it for my kid), Books about programming for kids, and actually programming (like https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby which is based on _why tutorials).

 Any way you/ your kid will choose should be a great way to learn and to play, and as it seems today some very clever people do think everyone should learn to program.
