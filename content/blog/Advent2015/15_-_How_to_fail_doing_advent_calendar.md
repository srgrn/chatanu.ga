So this was a fun experiment and it failed.

In order to do an Advent Calender you must prepare in advance and not start on 30/Nov.
You need to collect posts, guest posts, tips for 24 days and set it up for auto publish.

It is very hard writing so many posts to keep up, if you try to do it during december. Espcially since I was going on vacation and time is always limited on vacations.

regular posting will resume after December 26 with some more improvements. 

Thanks for reading.
