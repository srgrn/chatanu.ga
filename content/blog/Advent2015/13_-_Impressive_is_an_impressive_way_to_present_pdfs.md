A couple of months ago I gave an [ignite talk](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) at [DevOps Days TLV](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-telaviv/), you can see more details on this here: {{< relref "learning_through_answering.md" >}}.
In order to practice I needed to an easy way to present with automatic forwarding and a time counter on linux . All those features (including multiplatform) on Impressive.
<!--more-->

[Impressive](http://impressive.sourceforge.net/) is a very simple tool with very advanced features. It basically allow you to play any pdf file as a presentation and using its flags allow automatic forwarding, time counter per each frame and time counter per the entire presentation.

This is a great tool to use when trying to prepare for a lecture or a talk.
The easiest way is to convert your notes/presentation into PDF as all tools can do today easily.
Than you can simply play it automatically and set the time between frames, the time each frame will be on the board, and set the total time.

I hope Ill remember this tip when it is time for another talk.
