This is not a great tip.
It is something I seem to keep forgetting even after using it so many times.

Finding a specific object/hash in a python list by attribute/value
<!--more-->

```specific = [x for x in hashlist if x['somefield'] == 'searchvalue']```

This returns an array of hashes matching the specific field.

While this probably shows you needed to use a hash instead of a list with some unique key that can be used to select sometimes we work with old code and must fit to it instead of the other way around.

Hope it helps.
