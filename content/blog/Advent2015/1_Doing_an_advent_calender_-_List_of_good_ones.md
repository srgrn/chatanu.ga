A few years ago I heard of the concept of [Advent Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar). 

It was a Perl Calender so each day they had a nice little post about Perl. Since than I found some others and I really wanted to be part of it or create my own.

So without Further explanations, here is the first post in my little Advent Calender - some good advent Calenders:

  - [SysAdvent](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com) - this will be considered today as a devops calender as it is mostly about configuration management and similar stuff.
  - [Perl Advent Calendar](http://perladvent.org/2015/) - The original Perl advent calender which sparked my interest. Only if your a Perl developer.

Weird I remember following four calendars last year and some others on ruby before that but they seem to be missing in the sea of Japanese advent calenders.

Any way this is just first post of those.
