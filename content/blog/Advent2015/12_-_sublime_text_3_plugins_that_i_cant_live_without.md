This is a very short list of plug-ins that I usually add each time I install sublime text.

* Package Control - To install other plug-ins easily duh.
* Case Conversion - Convert many types of case to other types like camelCase -> camel.case and some others.
* Anaconda - To easily write python scripts and modules (also to support virtualenvs completions).
* Markdown Preview - Since you always find stuff to write markdown it allows you to see how it will look as html.
* ColorSublime - This is great when you need to kill an hour by cycling through 100 very very similar themes.
* SideBarEnhancements - This is the latest addition, I have heard of it and used it before but never found a use for it that will make it great, well it has a rename file function that you can call using keyboard only (through command palette).

As I said very short list, and a very simple one.
If you know of other great ones I'm missing let me know in the comments so I will know this post was reads.
